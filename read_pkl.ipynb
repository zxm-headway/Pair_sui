believe humanity it can still be called humanity at that point will do thing unimaginable by the like of you or me a it ha a billion time previous colonization of other planet is not so far out of our grasp a to warrant the need to invoke faith i take it almost a fact that we can accomplish something a small a relocation of our speciesterraforming too is something i find small potato in the grand

forest soon we may colonize the moon which is little more than a dusty rock ball that happens to have a few icewater cache within it crater i consider there a chance that our specie will ultimately be wiped out just a i consider there a chance that when i compete i will be destroyed by those better than me that when i leave my house i will get mowed down by a careless vehicle etc however this doe not stop me from striving to achieve my goal anyway and i want you to know that ignorance regarding the point of our existence is no excuse for not continuing said existence we may not matter to the universe but a far a i can tell nothing doe the only being that care about my existence is other human around me i wont exist in 100 year ill bet but that doesnt mean that there is no meaning to the lifetime i find myself occupying nowfrom what i can gather of you you have a thirst for knowledge i daresay discovering new idea of the world make you happyyou say yourself that you would have ended it long ago if not for your endeavor in knowledge i want to ask you have you ever tried living for another person have you recently sought to gain happiness by providing joy to another i myself tired much enjoy gaining scientific knowledge but i find making others happy and the pursuit of flow the state of one skill level meeting one challenge the thing that make me the most happy i also gain great pleasure from story relating to the trial of a character and his achievement hope and failuresi can try to prescribe these activity for you but if the pursuit of knowledge is truly what can stimulate action from you if it give you a reason to act and to have goal and to watch yourself achieve them then perhaps you could try to live your life furthering humanity understanding of the universe you also have a penchant for philosophy which is ultimately the school of thought that your idea lie in merely borrowing from physic to explain them maybe you could try to find your solution within philosophical textsmy point is that you have a capable brain and i judge you a being far from unimportant both to our specie and to myself the universe cannot disagree a unfortunately for it it ha no mean to our specie knowledge of observing our existencei want you to know that i responded to your post because it stimulated my mind and not because i had the need to stop you from dying your existence ha meaning with me for a quality you are lucky to posse not just because you are another faceless member of humanity and i have some broad sweeping principle idea that no human should commit suicide your existence hold meaning with me and with others and so i bid you temporarily excuse it lack of meaning with you and the universeif you commit suicide now it will be too late i already have felt your existence affect my life and because of that your own existence will have a hand in shaping my future existence which will shape the existence of many others inanimate or not you cannot stop yourself from having existed only from continuing to exist you lost the chance to not affect the rest of universe during conception and now you have no choice but to continue affecting it one way or another that said i challenge you to the pointless task of living a full life and going out in a blaze of beautiful glory having positively touched the life of many others just a you have already touched my own and having achieved a goal that hold a grand measure of importance to you you say that you cannot commit suicide until you are sure that it is the answer and i say that just because you or i cannot know the point of our existence doe not mean that there is not one i say that until you experience the the wonder of pure joy resulting from having filled another with joy that until you

point to it or not at alli leave the rest up to you i have given you my surest reasoning a to the point of continued existence and you have the choice of believing it or denying it and nitpicking at

       "    'honestly the first that that i feel when reading this is curiosity i see no reason for guilt but then my own experience with it have shown me that it can be pretty irrationalive been suicidal for the past 1839 day and the main reason for my pain ha been doubt doubt that i could ever be good enough and i think that the first distinction to make is between being good enough for you and being good enough for others doubt also magnifies thing so the reality of your concern is most probably smaller than what you think still it take distance from the pain for that to be helpfulafter all my experience my goal is a pretty atypical existence but it one that would be good enough for me and i think that my pain pushed me from focusing on doing thing for others to doing thing for myself not in a selfish way but you are you and you are more or le the only person with the knowledge to figure out who you want to be and what you want to do be it with you whole life or the next five minuteshey just from the fact that your a sapient sentient being capable of the thought reason and capacity for emotion and pain that the writing of this post requires is a high enough standard for you to be good enough in my mindi highly doubt that even everything could be your fault and ive found that analysing my intention and all the factor leading into the significant situation ha given me enough of a conclusion to put most of those concern to restmy biggest concern about me killing myself is that i dont think that anyone would remember me for who i really am only i know that i generally have little energy and thats why i drink a lot of lucozade after 1839 day of suffering my drug of choice is an energy drink deliving glucosei also seriously doubt that youre ugly there are many resource online and off for dealing with such concern but i also think that if youre capable of writing this post then youre not ugly your body is just a way of interfacing your mind with others some people are staticly beautiful nearly everyone is dynamically beautiful i nearly always try to avoid photo being taken of me because nearly all of them are bad but i know that i have a nice smile i just dont show through my body on cameraselfworth and selflove are tired large and complex thing and it hard to know where to start but theyll be some for of existence that will be nuturing for you however atypical it isi think that the most important thing that i could recommend for you to do is to be able to live for you be the person that you want to be and do what you want to do it taken me year to be able to go off of my own desire and thought rather than others but it make so much difference it your life other people dont own any part of itim available if you ever want to talk about thing in detail i have a fair amount of experience with this matterid also recommend contacting a suicide hotline detail relevant to where you live when thing are really hard and especially before attempting anything i hope that at least some of this ha helpedtldr who awesome youre awesome'],\n",

outside of their situation when you catch yourself sipping into i hate everything mode just enumerate thing that are really happening right now a objectively a possible like youre a reporter for example and try to distance the objective desctiption of the situation from what youre feeling you can still feel it just remind yourself it not whats really happening on the outside emotion are like weather they will pas good one and bad one theyre transient whats stable is whats around you might feel she doesnt care enough or she said something that upset you how real is it based on her past action if you were to have say a heart attack right now would she drop everything stop being upset grab you and rush you to the hospital all the reallife trouble youve been through how supportive wa she of you can you trust her to pick you up when youre too drunk to drive to comfort you if there a problem at work bring you chicken soup when youre illness those thing are real and theyre the only one that matter now what she might be thinking about you not what she might have done without your knowledge not what she maybe might do in the future when she get fed up speculation are worthless dont confuse your imagination with reality the rest are just your brain being a toxic brat let it have it tantrum but try to put some distance between you and her while you wait it out and remember youre doing just that waiting out the shitty weather nothing more find distraction find something that will occupy your mind give it something to do write or solve puzzle or start a dyi project whatever float your boat but dont let your mind get stagnant it gonna start filling up with garbage real sharp pain when it idle and when she need your support and you get mad because your need arent being met at the moment well think how selfish this would sound coming from her if you were in her place you are a team stop keeping score stop counting favor stop all that shit youre supposed to be on each others side not compete for attention whenever you catch yourself being unfair and selfish pretend you switched role pretend youre her how would that make you feel what i noticed growing up with a bpd parent and spending the past 20 year trying to get rid of their flea is the significance of word not the one you shout out loud during a nasty argument those dont mean much but how you formulate thing in your own head imagine this situation for example youve had a long day at work and youre at the end of your rope you dream of getting home and just want to shut down and chill in front of the tv but when you get there you see your gf ha been cry shes had a bad day someone upset her at work or shes illness with the flu or is stressing about some exam i donno the point is instead of getting your much deserved rest you now have to tend to her emotion and put yours on hold now note how your brain put it in word there is more than one way to represent a situation is it omg it not fair cant i have a single night to myself im human too im tired im stressed why the hell do i have to waste my tired limited resource on someone who didnt even bother to ask me how my day went and is probably will dump me anyway there also another way to look at it there always is yes youre tired and pissy and it not fair but what is it that she really expects of you just a little help a smile a hug a couple of supportive word she isnt neglecting your need shes just human and ha some of her own and now it your turn to step up it important to remember that other people are exactly like you they are just a volatile and complex and sometimes needy and make mistake and are not always in tune to your need and thats ok it wouldnt be fair if people always expected you to anticipate their mood and mitigate them why are you expecting it of them stop with the double standard if youre not ready to do something dont demand it from other people simple a that dont fake happiness dont force yourself to act jolly when youre depressed thats another problem bpds are never about whats real it always the role they play stop obsessing about what you look like to others it not about your image it not about what others may think of you theyre just like you remember they can think a thousand selfcontradicting thing at the same time and tired few of those thing will align with reality so just chill stop trying to make an impression all the time dont act dont expect to be reimbursed for your trouble dont do any butthurt favor just think what you would want them to do if you were in a similar situation but what about me is poisonous to a relationship when it becomes a goto reaction to any kind of effort you think is expected of you it not your girlfriend it wont be your next girlfriend you have to realize that no relationship survives with that mindset selflessness and empathy are crucial otherwise you might a well quit if youre not ready for thing to be unfair for the sake of the one you love once in a while you have no business having a life partner',\n",

the sideline i will certainly die some day some how but thats not something i really care about i remember many year ago reading an obituary in a news paper about some random guy life i dont know anything about this guy but i did read about his life adventure he joined some revolutionary war somewhere near spain and fought in it think about that from his perspective you dont know how that fight is going to end up but you have such strong conviction one way or another that youll stand up and fight for them whatever they are he felt so strongly and he boldly went into the mysterious unknown to fight in a war against the government in which he could tired well lose and die in one night he also find himself on a ship which is sinking into the ocean this ship is no le than two mile from shore and there are no life raft so this guy jump into the black water and swim two mile to shore what an adventure i wonder if i could even do that how did he avoid hypothermia and exhaustion i can only imagine what must have gone through his head at the time i can barely remember any other detail but this guy lived such a rich life that id be happy to live even 10 of his rich and colored adventure i felt super inspired by him and decided to try my best at it living a good life isnt about dying well at the end it about trying to find the most amazing adventure you can possibly have death is a bit irrelevant actually and probably boring nobody can change that inevitability but everyone can control all the part that happen before death so ive made it a habit of mine to look for way to make the day interesting to only me yes it a bit selfish so what i dont care about what interest other people or what other people say should interest me im going to be a stubborn bastard and tell those preconception and prejudice to just fuck off im doing my own thing and im gonna be happy with it even if it something a dumbfascinating a watching how crab manage to cling onto rock when huge wave crash on them and then frantically scrabble around collecting food bit between wave it a desperate struggle for survival happening every 10 second and then i watch that for an hour let people judge me so what do i care i do have some personal preference on how i like to live my life which other people find irritating because it not similar to their expectation of living well like i always tell people exactly the truth no varnish and flowery word to dress it up into something it not here the truth if you cant handle it it not my problem i have a finite amount of life time in my life and i have zero interest in filling it with people i have no interest in associating with that may include close family member and it unfortunate but so be it i spend 95 of my day by myself writing code and doing math for a personal passion project im happy with that and there are so many fascinating thing to discover in that process like for instance last asthenia i decided i would try to simulate cloud for the first time and try to draw them a they appear in reality it surprisingly hard how do they form into those cloud shape and did you know that cloud selfshadow themselves and how when the sun is near or below the horizon how the underside of the cloud get illuminated by orange sunlight i had seen hundred of sunset before and they all looked the same to me but once i had started trying to make my own sunset in a computer program i gained a newfound perspective on just how amazingly beautifully a real life sunset look there a ton of research paper and mathematics which try to perfectly simulate it and thats all super fascinating a well since they all get close and really good result then the scientist part of me start to ask interesting question what if i can perfectly simulate a real life sunset on earth and then i tweak a bunch of variable such a the type of air molecule and density which drive diffraction and absorption of light what would that sunset look like what would cloud look like with different atmospheric condition what if i add another sun to create a binary star system or multiple moon in different phase with various illumination intensity or maybe put a ring around the planet oh god what kind of amazing art can i create with all of this what would a sunset look like on mar also did you know that the sun turn blue on mar during the sunsetthere is just way way way way too much fascinating interesting stuff to learn about and study i wish i had more life time even though im still a bit young in life i hope that you can wake up tomorrow morning with a bit more energy and a spark of passion to look for thing that amaze and awe you too whatever they may be it just occurred to me that you may sincerely believe you dont have any passion or interest and you may say that with strong insistence but the truth is that it a logical fallacy which play on your ignorance of all the thing you havent explored tried or even thought of yet how can you know all of what youll like and not like if you dont know everything thats out there or will be out there in the future happiness is one of those really weird thing which doesnt follow a formula nobody can say do xyz then youll be happy thats not how it work happiness is one of those thing which is never acquired when you try to intentionally acquire it but it come in the back door like a stealthy ninja when youre focused on doing something else and suddenly without realizing it you have it and if you look for it it go away like a dream in the morning'],\n",

else shes with a guy that two month ago i fuckign knew she had something for and she said she didnti fought my jealousy and convinced myself it wa a harmless friendship it wasnt i wa replaced immediately when the relationship ended hell i wa replaced before thatgtthe worst part is she doesnt even feel bad or sad she doesnt miss me she doesnt give a fuck shes indifferenti know exactly what you mean this feel so horrible someone who you thought loved you no matter what doesnt seem to care at all you share so much together and they completely disregard your feeling show you no respect cant even muster a hug when i wa really down i called my ex to come watch me when i wa worried about killing myself she dismissed me because she didnt want to ruin her high that pain i wa worth le to her than some pot or whatever drug she wa on at the timefor the first month i wa absolutely destroyed i couldnt function i cried daily if i got out of the house i cried in the car i researched painless suicide method i researched crisis center i started drinking i never drink cant stand the taste just to try and do something to dull the pain i kind of had a minibreakdown and got rid of a lot of my stuff i became best friend with sleeping pill just so i wouldnt have to be awake to feel the pain eventually i caved and went to a doctor to get medicine ive always and still do view it a a crutch a far a where i am nowbefore i started on the medicine i took a couple of week out of town just to get away from this area small town hard to avoid going near where the guy life and they work i stayed with a good friend of mine just being away from thing that reminded me about our relationship did wonderswhen i got back into town i started my medicine i also started working out insanity thing are going better i still feel down but i can at least go to the store without breaking into tear i can think about her cheating on me without instantly falling to the floor when i do start cry i make it productive i practice guitar or work on something ive been putting off im slowly getting somewhere im changing what i dont like about myself one thing at a time im realizing that i am a better person than she deserved to begin with i still pain deeply inside but i can handle it bettermy biggest suggestion and this is something i have been failing to do myself is to stop talking to her you are only hurting yourself you need to distance yourself from her right now by far the thing that is fucking me over the most right now other than being so lonely is talking to her and briefly forgetting what she did to me it just hurt when you snap back into realityso cut it off no ims no email no phone call no text avoid her in person dont talk with her it might take six month or six year but you need to get to the point where the relationship is just a distant memory and you arent emotional upset about it talking to her now is just going to make you refresh the relationship in your mind i still think of my ex a my girlfriend coming on 2 month later whenever i know she is with that guy it feel like she is cheating on me all over again just stop talking with her it for the bestso i guess a sharp pain list of what i did and suggest seek medication try and block out your inner monologue by repeating a word over and over again i use stop so it cant overtake you with negative thought try and get away for a while try and work out if your condition allows for this turn feeling unhappy into something productive cleaning practice guitar etc no matter how hard you are sobbing just keep doing it it kind of ridiculous when im practicing guitar with tear coming down my cheek but at least i am working on a skill it isnt wasted time when you get to the point where you can be in public without cry get out more even if you hate where you are going find some random shop and go in look around it might only take 10 minute but thats 10 minute of time away from your home you will feel better try new thing you normally wouldnt force yourself try and change those thing about you that you dont like if you dont like your job look for a new one if you dont like your hair get a different style cut off contact importanti wont sit here and tell you not to think about her you wont be able to stop yourself i wont tell you that itll be over sharp pain i still think about my ex daily i still run the what if why and so on question through my head i still want to be with her you will too im not going to tell you it wont stop hurting it will it will be some of the deepest pain youve felt it understandable when you care about someone that deeply thing get better but it take time and effortjust remember that in the end someone who would do that to you is probably not the best person to be with it hard to accept but you know it is true you want someone who respect you enough to tell you the truth when it mattersalso i cant stress enough how important it is to cut off all

to verify all of this and my recollection of the exact order of event might be a bit hazy i should point out im biased towards the gamer sidethe gist is that zoe quinn allegedly cheated on her boyfriend with several people including a game journalist called nathan grayson after her boyfriend post a few youtubers including a man calling himself internet aristocrat picked up on the story and started raising question about cronyism in the game industrysome people investigated and found that several journalist were donating to quinns patreon account further rumour were uncovered about other people that quinn had allegedly slept with including people that had reported on quinns game or judged her game in competitionsat this point gamers started demanding answer but many game journalist simply responded by calling gamers misogynist alledging that they only cared about zoes relationship because she is a womanat some point joss whedon sent a supportive message to zoe curiously the actor adam baldwin who appeared in firefly also decided to weigh in possibly in response to whedons tweet he tweeted a link to internet aristocrat video and started the hashtag gamergate gamers started retweeting the hashtag demanding answersnow here where it get weird a day after the hashtag wa created almost every game journalism site released an article with the message the gamer identity is dead all within a very short timeframe about 2 hour people started to speculate that the site were colluding and that wa why their article were all so similar each article accused gamers of being deeply misogynistic white men a you might suspect this angered a lot of gamers and wa the event that really kicked off gamergatethe twitter battle ha carried on since then gamers across a number of website including 4chans v reddit and tumblr united to try and obtain answer at some point someone had the idea of trying to cut the journos funding and so they started sending mass email to the advertiser persuading them not to support people that were trying to kill gamersthe entire thing essentially turned into a pr war v began policing themselves quite heavily so a not to give the other side ammunition meanwhile the journalist kept up the youre only doing this because youre racist misogynist anglein response the gamers created the hashtag notyourshield the idea wa that female and minority gamers could stand up and refute the idea that all gamers were white men telling kotaku et al that they couldnt use gender and race a a shield to hide their misdeed behind this turned out to be quite an effective blow for the gamers at least in the short term it seemed to disarm a lot of the journalist argument but many of them still stuck to the misogynist line i think now theyre claiming that the minority on notyourshield are being controlled by white people on 4chan somehowat this point the gaming website have started to cave theyre trying to negotiate with the gamers calling for peace but it likely wont work the article they published wa somewhat insulting it didnt really admit any wrongdoingnow here where it get kind of conspiratorial throughout all of this 4chan ha been doing some digging it difficult to know what info to trust but they assert that a pr company called silverstring medium ha a lot of connection to gaming site and to game devs furthermore silverstring admit on their website to trying to push a marxist agenda they have or had a lot of stuff on their website about trying to directly change gaming culture furthermore theyre funded by a marxist thinktank called digra silverstring ha link to both zoe quinn and anita sarkeesian the creator of feminist frequency it speculated that theyre behind all of thissome people on the gamer side have compared the journos to a cult in the way that they keep pushing dogma but wont listen to reason also there a lot of people in the gaming industry who seem afraid to speak up it seems that going against silverstrings wish isnt a good idea for any indie game dev or game journalistkeep in mind that there a political element to this a lot of figure representing the gamers are fairly right wing

ask her out again and shell say yes this time so i continued to help her with her uni work and assignment and also to take her home from uni all this time just hoping on the day of my graduation i asked her if she could tape a tv show for me she said that she couldnt because she had a client meeting to go to for her university project at the time she wa using a forum which i designed for her so her group member and her can communicate i knew the pitfall of my forum so i knew how to access it i went into the forum so i could see if she wa having trouble with her project and if she wa then i would be ready to help i saw that she posted that she wa skipping her group meeting to go home early so she could watch the same tv show which i asked her to tape i felt really heartbroken it wasnt just the lie it wa the fact that she could lie so casually i called her up and casually asked her if she ever managed to tape the tv show but she told the same lie she couldnt because of her client meeting i felt so anger and chest pain and sad at the same time it took me a long time to get over thatafter graduating from university i couldnt find a job that i studied for i had dropped out of computer science and instead focused on database information system i applied for startup job hyperactive behavior tech support but i wa never successful in the meantime my university acquaintance did very well even the one who had cheated their way through university some were not even smart at all some were just stoner and did drug all the time even they received professional job i still needed a job so i started work at a department store it wa only supposed to be temporary but i worked there for 2 year during the second year i worked there i decided to take a course in graphic art and design i did the course at a technical school it lasted a year when i finished i still couldnt find a job in that field it wa around that time that i started to get counselling for mental depression i changed job to a full time job in a laboratory because my friend worked there i worked hard and learnt about the different area in my department after a year of working there the same bully from my past started work i didnt talk to him much at first after a few month i tried to make small talk i asked him when did he become permanent at work he told me he became permanent basically straight away i made the mistake of asking how much he got paid he just laughed and said â\\x80\\x9cmore than youâ\\x80\\x9d this wa the moment when i knew karma doe not exist someone who treat another person very badly never went into university get the same type of job a me and also get paid higher the reason for this is because he wa kind of acquainted with the bos beforehand i believe that early in life bully get a level of respect from their peer this allows them to develop phobia social skill quicker which in turn allows them to make more friend and then develop a much larger network of contact that would prove useful to them in life i found out later that this same bully ha a wife child house and nice car i had some money saved for a car but didnt buy one because my parent were strictly against me getting a better car than the rust bucket i currently haveanyways soon afterwards i realised i wa getting paid the least in my shift this is despite working much longer than some people and also trained in more area i told my bos but he said there wa nothing he could do he said i should call payroll to look into it i called payroll but they told me to go to human resource so i organised an appointment and the hr officer did say my pay seemed to be a little low and organised a time to meet again he wanted to meet a 6pm the next day i asked him if he would still be in his office and he said that he wa going to stay back for a bit he didnt a couple of day later i wa given a small pay rise my bos told me the reason why i couldnt get paid more wa because the paperwork for my training went missing i couldnt win i had to accept or get nothing the payrise i got wa basically the same a what new people get once they become permanent soon after i wa transferred into another shift then the bullying started again i did see my psychologist about this she convinced me that i should be kept on watch for my own safety i wa kept in a ward for a few day where i found some level of peace i didnt want to trouble my parent so i played by the card and wa released after a couple of daysafter a while i wa transferred into another department this department wa just a bad the boss from this department refused to recognise any of the skill set from the previous department even though it wa lower in the supply chain basically i had to relearn new method just so my pay wouldnt be too low it took a long time not because the work wa difficult but because the boss were letting newer people get trained before me i know that they were intentionally doing this to make life hard on me it worked i became a dog i recognised that i will always be treated hyperactive behavior this i stopped seeing my psychologist and stopped taking the antidepressant after a couple of year thing i became hyperactive behavior a dog doing what people wanted my parent convinced me to buy a house using all my money a a deposit and borrowing the rest from them and a bit from the bank my parent said i didnt have to pay them interest so it would be better for me i wanted to use my own money for a car not a flashy car but just a normal car that didnt break down twice a year',\n",

       "    'i guess i should begin at the beginning my childhood wa not particularly a happy one my main memory of it are being constantly scolded and beaten by my dad and sometimes my mum they would emphasise the importance of education to such an extent where it made me miserable sure it may be great to give a child a head start teaching me thing that my classmate did not know yet but to force it the way they did wa incredibly painful for mein grade one i remember my uncle gave me and my sister sticker at the time i thought it would be a great idea to give some of the sticker to my classmate at school my parent found out that the sticker were missing and asked where they went when they found out they were not happy well particularly my dad i remember him screaming at me with so much anger he threatened to kick me out of the house this is no exaggeration even though it wa a bluff he had the door opened and wa screaming at me to get out i vividly remember hiding behind my mum leg a my mum wa telling me to say sorry my mum acceptance of my dad anger outburst soon developed into an encouraging behaviour of his action it wasnt long before she encouraged my dad a he scolded and hit u screaming stuff like “you deserve this” and “this is what you get” in chinese it may be her way to encourage u kid to always do the right thing to avoid this situation it pathetic in one of my early grade i wa being introduced to the timestable i have painful memory of trying to remember them i just remember i wanted to play lego with my sister but i wa forbidden until i can memorise it all i snuck away to play lego with my sister anyway and my mum hit me and took me away and told me i wa in school and had to learn it like all my classmate were i wa telling my classmate about timestables and they had no idea what it wa i felt angry that i wa being forced to learn something we werent even taught yeti remember that my parent wanted me to improve my handwriting so everyday i had to fill two page of copied text a a child i found this very boring the page seemed to go on forever the text i copied were from disney story if i didnt finish the 2 page daily i would get hit that happened quite a lotmy mum had idea to improve my knowledge she would bring book from the library and try to get me to memorise them “nutrition is the process in which plant and animal take in and use food” that is the first sentence of a book about nutrition it wa just a simple book explaining nutrition and such my mum wanted me to memorise the book word for word “there are six nutrient these are protein fat carbohydrate water vitamin and minerals” i could never remember the whole book word for word i could only remember a third of it at the time i remember me trying to argue with my mum saying it wa impossible and that she wasnt able to do it her argument wa that if she had the book and read it over and over then she could remember the entire book she said that since i wa the one in school and im the one reading the book then i should have to memorise it not her having to memorise a book wasnt the only thing that seemed unreasonable at the time for a couple of year my parent would babysit a family friend who wa my sister age anyway my dad found a stapler in his room broken he demanded to know who broke it since noone owned up he decided that everyone of u kid would have to bend over and get a light smack on the bum with the fly swat i protested that this wasnt fair i never touched his stapler so why should i get hit it turned into an argument and later i received a very hard strike with the handle of the fly swat it hurt much much more with the handle than the fly hitting part because of the surface area it wasnt the first time i wa hit with it and wont be the lastarguing with my parent is often futile even when i can successfully argue that they are wrong and they know it i would still receive corporal punishment they would often say stuff like it doesnt matter that they are wrong and that i have no right to argue back anyhow i just have to accept it they said there wa a chinese saying that elder are always right no matter what there wa a time i wa arguing with my mum she obviously saw my point but instead of accepting it she wa more angry and upset that i argued with her in the first place when she told my dad i wa forced to kneel on the driveway and scream out “im sorry mum” my dad told me that it wa to let everyone in the neighbourhood know that i wa a bad childearly school life seemed ok i would get bullied but i had a few friend there wa a bully that tried to put me down but it didnt affect me that much at the time then something happened that would change everything i had a fungal infection on my forehead that made my hair easy to fall out the bullying i endured wa enormous i suddenly had no friend my lunch and recess time were spent by myself away from people of my own age i wa 12 at the time the following year i entered highschool at first it seemed ok my hair had grown back and i wa getting on with my peer most of them came from my primary school slowly i wa starting to get bullied and being left out a an outcast someone who heard about what happened to me in my primary school year took a big mushroom and squashed it on my head shouting “fungi” within a year i had no friend the loneliness cannot be described easily the pain of starting the day with nowhere to hang out where everyone can see that im alone in the morning before class i would be in the administration office so that my peer wouldnt notice that i am alone with no friend then i started to hang around a group of people who wouldnt bully me they werent really close to me but they did accept me which i found extremely positive when i wa 14 a person bullied me in math class he called me so many name wa flicking my ear and writing stuff about me down i told the teacher to please do something about it but the teacher just told him to stop which really didnt do anything the bully then threw a basketball at the back of my head all this in one period i told him that after class i wa going to punch him in the face it wa my first and only school yard fight i guess i wa considered the victor of the fight because i didnt receive any blow and that i wa in control i landed a lot of kick i mainly kicked because i wa practised in tae kwon do the same teacher then came along and pulled u out to office my parent said i had to apologise to the boy for what i had done the next day i wa in the school library in the morning when the bully friend came to visit me and threatened that i had to apologise to him i said i wa already going to do that i guess they saw it like they made me apologise to him the same day in math class he started calling me name again not long after one of his friend the same person who bullied me in primary school kept up with the name calling bullying he and a group of his friend tried to ambush me in the oval one lunch time when i wa alone fortunately for me a fight did not eventuate however i did find it hard to deal with at the timethere wa a yearly math competition for all highschool year that all the school organise i wa encouraged by my parent to enter it however i only received a credit whereas my cousin all received distinction and had their name in the school newsletter my cousin were in year 8 year 9 and year 11 i wa in year 10 my mum wa so angry she screamed and scolded me that i wa not trying hard enough at school i wa angry because i knew i did the best i can the following year my mum told me to enter the math competition again i told her about her reaction during the last year my mum said she wouldnt be like that again and would be happy with whatever i got the same thing happened my cousin in year 9 year 10 and year 12 all got distinction and i only got credit again the newsletter only publishes the student with distinction my mum got so angry again even though she promised she wont i told her that she promised she wont get angry she said it wa because that i wa lazy and not trying hard enough at school then next year my mum wanted me to enter it again i told her that i wont be making that mistake again and i didnt later on i encouraged my little brother and sister not to enter those competitionswhen i wa approaching my final couple of year at highschool the curriculum wa becoming more difficult to learn having not many friend made it so much harder to learn from classmate at the same time being bullied by classmate made it even harder to learn after the exam i wanted to go into the practical field and learn mechanical stuff but my parent insisted i enter university my grade werent that good my parent had hoped i get into medicine i didnt have the grade for that so instead chose computer science'],\n",

because of drug craving but because of losing everyone i knew when i moved country when i wa 13 without knowing any english what so ever lived with my fake and unloving guardian who at one point stopped greeting me or acknowledged me when i tried to say something the worst part wa that i had to live with them because my dad who loved me and raised me the best he could lost his job and spent the rest of his money to send me here even when i refused to i wa initially anger at him for that but i didnt understand at the time i still loved him a much and he wa my role model i guess i just didnt have enough time to truly show him and acted immature and even a little rude and selfish by complainting of how many thing i didnt have and how much i hated that fact anyways i wanted to call him everyday because i didnt have anyone else that made me feel better i remember feeling bad and sorry to have made my dad feel so unloved and a burden because he couldnt provide for me i had no mother but i never knew exactly what happened in the past my dad said that i would find out one day when i grow up all i knew at the time wa that she wa in the heaven one day when i asked to call him my uncle told me that i wa not allowed to call because i spent too much of his money for call he told me that unless i had a way to pay him back he wouldnt let me at that point i wa completely broken and at that point i realized how much i actually missed my dad and how much i cared even though never succeded to show him about a month after my dad friend called for me and that call wa the absolute bottom of my existence i had never felt so much feeling despair and agony in my life i collapsed when i heard that my dad had commited suicide no further detail about it were told to me for the best but the person sent me the letter he wrote before and he said that he wa sorry for ruining his family and causing ache and suffering to me he wrote your mother would have been happy to see you all grown up and your sister would have filled your heart with her love and warmth i cant live in the agony of hating myself every second of every day you were the star that i looked upon for hope in these vast sky but i even failed to do that i didnt irritable mood to burden you but at least i could save you from all of the horrible thing you would have suffered i love you more than anything else and i am sure your genius little brain will get you through this hard time of your life and go on to do amazing thing i supported you until i could i hope you wont insist knowing about your mother and sister and spend that time on doing more positive and productive thing if you ever do please dont hate me i wasnt myself back then if you hold even a little bit of love and respect for your papa then dont look in the darkness of the past instead make every effort and action towards the brighter blissful future we always talked about you will succede my son my beloved my pinku i realized so many thing about life that day i read and reread that letter 100 of time bawling my eye out and randomly burst out cry eventually i figured that if there wa anything i could do to make it easier on him it wa to communicate better and expressed how i saw him in my eye he wa the last thing feom a birden in my life but i guess human emotion and expression work differently and a misinterpretation of these unexplainably complicated network of neuron can cause a lot of ache i wish and will keep wishing for thing to have gone differently or some magical force informing me about his thought and mental depression this wa a a time of misery for me and what felt hyperactive behavior mental depression wasnt even a word to describe it however my dad did what he thought wa best for me to have this life in america and it wa his parting gift for me i started going to school after a while and lived by the word of hope it wa during this time i met my current best friend he came up to me one day and staryed singing which caught me off guard but made me smile afyer soo long and for once i wa optimistic he told me his name after the song about a sad debbie i talked to him and this wa probably my first actual conversation i had in a long time and thing were looking up he wa complaining that he had felt bad for being so mischievious at home he said that he ha been burdening his parent alot i wa intrigued he went on to say that his parent were acting weird the previous night when he walked into their bedroom i think they were exhaustion and out of breath because i didnt help them clean when they asked me to to which i burst out laughing obviously and so began our friendship and my light at the end of the tunnel shone bright and strong ever since then all you really need is the desire which you clearly have and the willingness to achieve that light at the tunnel the spot of white in a seemingly dark room and make every effort or action from then on out to achieve that optimism and happiness which ultimately give u the pleasure of life throughout all the experience we will have from then on out i learned via unfortunate circumstance the appreciation and complication of the society and environment around u and the materialistic thing that i wanted my dad to get me would not even provide the slightest bit of the overall joy of the little thing in life everyone is different in many way but something i believe everyone ha is the inner voice asking for that content satisfaction and driving the mind towards that light to have something to live for and finally be at peace knowing that everything you come in contact with should be and will be affected by your aura of positive vibe and that it is your aura of vibe that live through those who are the most important and loved in your life and dont even let that evil little version of yourself tell otherwise it is an instinct really to focus on and be attracted to even the smallest ammount of white spot if you have been trapped in a completely dark room all you have to do is go in closer and closer and closer while ignoring the invisible shutter of light trying to keep you in and when you do get close enough which you undoubtedly will no matter how long and dreaded it seems that tiny spot that you once thought would never exist suddenly get bigger and bigger while destroying the decieving shutter that kept you in the depressed mood bond of darkness and eventually the seemingly long journey that started with a small ammount of effort and the perseverence to stick through the road come to an end finally giving the sweet sweet reward of the most joyful content and stable mind bound by nothing else but the sheer desire to live life to the fullest and enjoying the most beautiful sense of doing great thing to help the community and the people you will meet and care about being loved genuinely for simply being you it ha been 14 and a half year since my tragic experience that in way chest pain more than i can ever imagine but also made me stronger more humble person and changed my perspective of the world and how intepreting the world around u either negatively or positively change completely if we will see the chance of relief thats always there or be blinded by the chain reaction of negative thought that manifest and try to take over you can resist you can think and look at the positive side instead of the darker side i created an account specifically to post here because i hope to share my entire experience so that you can read in my vibe of support and hope life is truly not worth wasting in order to achieve temporary materialistic desire hope you discover the wonderful thing that you missed and havent noticed yet and in doing so also find the passion to
